# GlowBook â€” Sprint 1 Skeleton

This zip contains the `lib/` folder and `pubspec.yaml` for Sprint 1.
Use it to replace the default `lib/` after running `flutter create glowbook`.

## Quickstart

```bash
flutter create glowbook
cd glowbook
# replace lib/ and pubspec.yaml with the ones in this zip
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Notes
- Rendering is a scaffold; brush engine wires are in place.
- Default brush: Liquid Neon.
- Undo/Redo, size and color pickers are stubbed for Sprint 1 tasks.
